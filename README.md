# Star Classification ML Project

Here I implemented several models to classify stars based on features like magnitude, luminosity, temperature, etc. I've compared five models through basic training and cross-validation. After hyperparameter tuning, I selected the best model and evaluated it using the confusion matrix and classification report.

## Features
- Uses Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Implements KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes
- Includes preprocessing, scaling, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Installation
You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
